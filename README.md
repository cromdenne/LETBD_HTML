# Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous

This is a sample website made as part of [*Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous*](https://www.learnenough.com/html-tutorial).

After finishing *Learn Enoughâ„¢ HTML to Be Dangerous*, you'll know enough HTML to be dangerous. For me that just means I'll have brushed up on my basic HTML skills and completed one more tutorial in the path to learning Ruby on Rails within the Learn Enough tutorial path.
